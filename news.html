                        COLORADO SPRINGS - SpaceX called off the first attempt to launch its integrated Starship vehicle from Texas April 17 because of a valve problem.

                        SpaceX announced it was scrubbing the launch of its Starship vehicle and Super Heavy booster from its Starbase test site at Boca Chica, Texas, less than 10 minutes before the scheduled 9:20 a.m. Eastern liftoff, after reporting a pressurization issue with the booster.

                        WASHINGTON - An Ariane 5 successfully launched a European spacecraft on an eight-year journey to Jupiter April 14 on the penultimate flight of the venerable rocket.

                        The Ariane 5 lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 8:14 a.m. Eastern after weather scrubbed a launch attempt the previous day. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, spacecraft separated from the Ariane upper stage 26 minutes after liftoff.

                        Controllers made contract with JUICE about 40 minutes after liftoff and, a half-hour later, deployed its two large solar arrays with a total area of 85 square meters that will generate power for the six-ton spacecraft.

                        The acquisition of signals from JUICE took place a little later than expected, although still within the nominal window for doing so. Solar array deployment took place a little earlier than expected. Jean-Marc Nasr, head of space systems at Airbus Defence and Space, explained at a post-launch briefing that the array deployment took place earlier because the sun acquisition by spacecraft systems was precise. "It is a sign of a perfect mission," he said.
